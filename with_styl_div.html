		<div class="firstdiv">
		<p>The Hulk and Thor have <span class="heading">bickered </span>back and forth about who the strongest superhero is. Sure, The Hulk claims he is the strongest of all time but is he correct in his assessment? What would happen if the Norse god and the radiated scientist got into a fistfight? Is Thor’s god-like power more impressive than Banner’s rage-induced superstrength? It’s not as simple as you might think.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="seconddiv">
		<p><h3><span class="heading">Who has the strongest base strength?</span></h3></p>
		<p>Strength can’t be measured in just one way. There is sheer power, base strength and bursts of energy. Everyone can probably agree that The Hulk most likely has the most powerful bursts of power, but when it comes to base strength, Thor is absolutely the winner.</p>
